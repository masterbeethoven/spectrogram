spectrogram
===========

this was supposed to be just spectrumAnalyzer.m what happened

A MATLAB function that creates spectrogram data. The spectrogram is an intensity plot (typically using the dB scale) of the magnitude of the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). We define the STFT as a sequence of FFTs of a signalâ€™s windowed data. The data segments usually overlap in time.
Uses the command window in MatLab.
